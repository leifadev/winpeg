**System**: `DIR HERE`

## Can I trust this app?

Yes! The code is completely public and you can see for yourself exactly what it does. Python is a simple language to read, and a non-programmer can get the gist of anything at least to fishy that could be going on.

For those fluent you can easily see more that this script doesn't do anything harmful at all. In fact, here is a simple verbaliszed process that    the code does below.


### Can I trust this app: How does it work?

This is the simple process of what happens:

>1. Configures variables such as direcory spots to store files (including ffmeg) and other app data
> 2. Script downloads icon for itself
> 3. Initializes GUI elements windows and buttons, configures dark mode and more
> 4. Executes script to download latest windows ffmpeg binary (app)
> 5. Stores and moves it to the specified directory
> 6. Makes a enviorment variable to link it to be a command to use for user's and other apps requiring it
> 7. Bakes you a cake!
